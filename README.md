Harvest Hope: Redirecting Food Waste to Fight Hunger

Project Overview

Harvest Hope is a real-time Salesforce project designed to equip students and cross-technology professionals with practical knowledge in Salesforce platform essentials. By completing this project, participants will gain hands-on experience with Salesforce Admin, Development, and Community features, which can be showcased on resumes to enhance career transitions into Salesforce roles.

Objectives

1.	To build a Salesforce platform that facilitates efficient food donation and distribution.
2.	To provide real-time insights into food waste, donor engagement, and meals served to enhance hunger relief efforts.
3.	To offer hands-on Salesforce skills, particularly in Admin, Development, and Community components, supporting resume-building for Salesforce roles.
   
Salesforce Admin

1.	Objects & Relationships:
   
    o	Custom objects (e.g., Food Donation, Food Recipient) and fields to capture essential data.
  	
    o	Lookup and Master-Detail relationships connecting donors, donations, and recipients.
  	
2.	Sharing Rules, OWD, & Roles:
   
	  o	Configured for secure and collaborative access, setting up Object-Level Security (OLS), Field-Level Security (FLS), and Role Hierarchy.
  	
    o	Ensures controlled data visibility among stakeholders.
  	
3.	Salesforce Community (Customer Community):
   
    o	Provides an interactive interface for donors and recipients.
  	
    o	Tailored access to enable participants to log, manage, and track donations.
  	
Salesforce Development

1.	Apex Triggers:
   
    o	Custom triggers for automated tasks (e.g., updating status upon donation receipt).
  	
2.	Batch Apex:
   
    o	Efficient processing of large datasets, especially for scheduled tasks like donation cleanup based on expiration dates.
  	
3.	Future Methods:
   
    o	Asynchronous processing for tasks requiring delays, such as notifying recipients when food donations are logged.
  	
4.	Integration (REST & Apex REST APIs):
   
    o	External integrations to connect the Salesforce system with other applications or platforms for data sharing and real-time updates.
  	
Lightning Web Components (LWC)

1.	Custom Components:
   
    o	Components for user interaction, donation tracking, and insights on the Customer Community platform.

2.	Events and Navigation:
   
    o	Event handling within LWCs for a responsive UI, including custom navigation and toast notifications for user updates.
  	
3.	Custom Lookup:
   
    o	Advanced custom lookups to link records (e.g., linking donations to specific donors).
  	
4.	Calling Apex (Wire & Imperative):
   
    o	Enables real-time and user-initiated data retrieval, enhancing the dashboard's interactive experience.
  	
5.	Community Integration:
   
     o	LWC components are embedded within the Customer Community for seamless donor and recipient engagement.
  	
Reusable Error Handling Framework

â€¢	A framework to capture, log, and handle errors effectively within the application. This ensures improved error visibility and troubleshooting across various components, enhancing system reliability.

Project Structure

1.	Admin: Configuration of objects, fields, sharing rules, and community settings.
2.	Development: Includes Apex triggers, batch processing, future methods, and REST API integrations.
3.	UI/UX: Lightning Web Components supporting a user-friendly Community interface.
4.	Error Handling: Centralized framework for error capture and logging.
